        <h2 className="question">What is Welding?</h2>
        <p className="answer">
          Welding is a fabrication process that involves joining materials,
          usually metals, by causing fusion. This is typically achieved by
          melting the workpieces and adding a filler material to form a molten
          pool, which, when cooled, solidifies and creates a strong joint.
          Welding is widely used in various industries for constructing and
          repairing structures,as well as in the fabrication of metal-based
          products,and <b>We are "Arc Welders"</b> .

        <h2 className="question">Arc Welding?</h2>
        <img src="./images/img23.jpg" alt="Window" className="pho" />
        <p className="answer">
          Shielded Metal Arc Welding (SMAW): Also known as stick welding, it
          uses a flux-coated electrode. The electric arc forms between the
          electrode and the workpiece, melting both the electrode and the
          workpiece.
